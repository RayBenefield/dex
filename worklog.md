## #3

Decided to work on the CLI tool right away and jump right into interface design.
Created the project folder and made modifications to make sure it was easy to
publish every time I needed to. Made sure versioning was working correctly and
everything. Should be good to go now and I'll just start working on the
interface interaction design now and then get back to use cases another time.

## #2

Spent some time organizing the Brainstorming done in the first session into
Business, Product, and Technology concerns. Then started work on the initial use
cases. Got about halfway through, luckily this is a very small MVP with just a
simple time tracker that is aware of 25 minute sessions is all. Below you can
see the current progress:

## #1

Initial brainstorming for my Pomodoro Technique time tracking application for
the [**ProductHunt Global Hackathon**](https://www.producthunt.com/hackathon).
Just spit out a bunch of ideas that I could think of before jumping in to
things. Below is an image of the initial thoughts:
